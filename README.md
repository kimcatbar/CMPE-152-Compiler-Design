# CMPE-152-Compiler-Design

This project takes PASCAL code as input from a text file and outputs what kind of token word they are. 
This assignment is useful as it detects keywords and categorizes them for futuremanipulation. 
You can run this code by running the makefile from your terminal. 
You can contact team KKCS at kimberly.manzano@sjsu.edu.
